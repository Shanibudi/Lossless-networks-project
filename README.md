# 🧠 PFC Pause Propagation: CBD Formation and Deadlock Demo

This repository contains a Python-based simulator that demonstrates how Priority Flow Control (PFC) can lead to cyclic buffer dependency (CBD) behavior in lossless networks, including buffer buildup, link pauses, and deadlock simulation.

The simulator models a simplified leaf-spine topology where each switch has a single shared buffer, and packets are injected step-by-step according to predefined traffic flows. PFC is triggered whenever a downstream buffer crosses a threshold, potentially creating a circular wait condition.

The project includes two scenarios:

🟦 **Scenario 1:** Cyclic dependency without deadlock  
🟥 **Scenario 2:** Same dependency with an extra flow causing deadlock  


## ⚙️ Dependencies

Install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib networkx
```

## 🚀 How to run the simulation script

You can run:

```bash
python pfc_cyclic_dependency_sim.py 
```

Optional flags:

- `--scenario {1,2,both}` - select which scenario to run (default: both)
- `--steps N`  (default: 30) — number of simulation steps.
- `--out_dir PATH`  (default: `.../fattree_lossless_networks/plots`)
- `--reports_dir PATH` (default: `.../fattree_lossless_networks/reports`)


## 📝 Output 
Running the script generates:

- `/plots` directory containing topology and simulation plots for each scenario
	
- `/reports` directory containing text summaries of each scenario execution
